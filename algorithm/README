In this folder, a real time QRS detection function is relized
The main de-noising algorithm is wavelet

QRS Detection pipeline is:

1. Get a new point
2. Applay wavelet transform and i-wavelet transform
3. Differentiate the wave and get derivative
4. Calculate squaring function of derivative array
5. Integrate the array (search and refresh the peak at the same time)
6. Detect a peak and check distance between the last peak
